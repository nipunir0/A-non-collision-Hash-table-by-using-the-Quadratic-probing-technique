The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of jitter on
range measurement in AMCW ToF range imaging. This is achieved by three
main contributions: a development of a common algorithm for measurement of
the jitter present in signals from depth cameras, secondly the proposal of a cost
effective alternative method to measure jitter by using a software defined radio
receiver, and finally an analysis of the influence of jitter on range measurement.
Among the three contributions of this thesis, first, an algorithm for jitter
extraction of a signal without access to a reference clock signal is proposed.
The proposed algorithm is based upon Fourier analysis with signal processing
techniques and it can be used for real time jitter extraction on a modulated
signal with any kind of shape (sinusoidal, triangular, rectangular). The method
is used to measure the amount of jitter in the light signals of two AMCW
ToF range imaging cameras, namely, MESA Imaging SwissRanger 4000 and
SoftKinetic DepthSense 325. Periodic and random jitter were found to be
present in the light sources of both cameras with the MESA camera notably
worse with random jitter of 159.6 ps RMS in amplitude. Next, in a novel approach,
an inexpensive software defined radio (SDR) USB dongle is used with the proposed
algorithm to extract the jitter in the light signal of the above two ToF cameras.
